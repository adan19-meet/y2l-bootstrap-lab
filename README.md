##Lab 1

1. Create 2 rows, each divided into 2 columns; the first column should contain an image of an animal of your choice while the second one has its name and some interesting information about it.

2. If you shrink the size of the screen to a smartphone size you can notice that the image could get outside of the column borders that include it (You can do that by **Inspecting the page** and then right above the website you can adjust the screen-size). Google how to fix that. (hint: you need to make the image's width compatible with it's parent) 

3. Make a crousel that displays the images of the animals you listed previously.
